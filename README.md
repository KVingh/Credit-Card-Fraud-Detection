# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

Overview
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project is aimed at identifying whether a new credit card transaction is fraudulent or not. This is accomplished by modeling past credit card transactions, with knowledge of those that have previously been identified as fraudulent. We employ various predictive models to evaluate their accuracy in distinguishing between normal payments and fraudulent transactions. The classification techniques used in this project include Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and Na√Øve Bayes.
