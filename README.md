# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Abstract
The Credit Card Fraud Detection project aims to identify whether a new transaction is fraudulent or not by modeling past credit card transactions with knowledge of those that turned out to be fraud. This project uses various predictive models such as Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, SVC, and Na√Øve Bayes to detect whether a transaction is a normal payment or fraud. Credit card fraud events occur frequently and result in significant financial losses. This paper focuses on four main fraud occasions in real-world transactions and uses datasets provided by Kaggle, including all transactions recorded over the course of two days.

## Introduction
Credit card fraud is a significant issue that results in substantial losses for banks and issuer companies. This project explores various fraud detection methods, including machine learning algorithms, to mitigate this problem. Credit card fraud detection is challenging due to limited data, varying data distribution, and evolving datasets.

## Proposed Methods
This project uses the following machine learning techniques:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## Code
The code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation can be found in the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script.

## Result
The results of the fraud detection models are provided, including accuracy and confusion matrices.

## Conclusion
Credit card fraud detection is a crucial task for banks and financial institutions. The project presents the advantages of data mining techniques, such as neural networks, logistic regression, and decision trees, in solving the credit card fraud detection problem. It suggests that neural networks and logistic regression outperform decision trees for this purpose.
